# R.O.C.H.E.R Protocol (Robust and Optimized Communication Harnessing Enhanced Resilience)

**R.O.C.H.E.R** is an ultra-secure communication protocol designed for critical environments, such as military applications and highly confidential systems. It relies on a robust and modern architecture using advanced technologies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of communications.

## Features

- **Advanced encryption**: Utilizes **AES-256-GCM** to secure messages.
- **Post-quantum key exchange**: Implements **Kyber** for quantum-resistant security.
- **Attack detection**: Protection against replay attacks with strict time windows.
- **Modularity**: Designed as an independent protocol, easily integrable into other systems.
- **GNARK Compatibility**: Secure authentication based on zero-knowledge proofs.

---

## Architecture

The protocol follows a strict client-server architecture with a clear separation of responsibilities:

1. **Protocol**:
   - Located in the `pkg/communication` package.
   - Independent from the client and server for easy integration.

2. **Modules**:
   - **Encryption**: Handles sensitive data using AES-GCM.
   - **Compression**: Reduces message size with Gzip.
   - **Key exchange**: Implements Ed25519 and Curve25519.
   - **Anti-replay**: Manages sequences and timestamps to prevent duplicates.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Go (Golang).
- **Libraries**:
  - `golang.org/x/crypto` for advanced encryption.
  - `github.com/sirupsen/logrus` for structured logging.
- **Security Standards**:
  - AES-256-GCM for encryption.
  - Kyber for post-quantum keys.
  - HMAC-SHA256 for message integrity.

## Usage Example

Here is a simple example showing how to send and receive a secure message using the R.O.C.H.E.R protocol.

### Client Code

```go
package main

import (
    "net"
    "github.com/your-username/protectora-rocher/pkg/communication"
)

func main() {
    conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:8080")
    sharedKey := []byte("thisisaverysecurekey!")

    err := communication.SendMessage(conn, "Hello, secure world!", sharedKey, 1)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

### Server Code

```go
package main

import (
    "net"
    "github.com/your-username/protectora-rocher/pkg/communication"
)

func main() {
    listener, _ := net.Listen("tcp", ":8080")
    for {
        conn, _ := listener.Accept()
        sharedKey := []byte("thisisaverysecurekey!")
        go communication.HandleConnection(conn, sharedKey)
    }
}
```
